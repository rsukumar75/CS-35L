1. I created this file using emacs.

2. I checked out version 3.0 of diffutils into a new branch named "quote".

Command: git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. I applied my patch to this new branch by running the patch command.

Command: patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

4. I learned how to use the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window
(C-x 4 a)

5. I used the above Emacs function to create a ChangeLog for the changes I made
to the 6 .c files.

Command: emacs
	 C-x 4 a

I entered the following description in the ChangeLog.
  	* src/cmp.c:    Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')
        * src/diff.c:   Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')
        * src/diff3.c:  Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')
        * src/dir.c:    Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')
        * src/sdiff.c:  Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')
        * src/util.c:   Replaced all backticks (`) with apostrophes (')

6. I then moved to the diffutils directory, staged the changed and committed them.

Command: cd diffutils
	 git add .
	 git commit -F ../ChangeLog

7. I then used the git log command to find the commit ID for the last commit.

Command: git log

I then used the command "git format-patch" to generate a file formatted-patch.txt.

Command: git format-patch -1 28dde97b2b13e6ac319b03a38c86df5533d2d6ee --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt

8. I verified that my patch worked with a partner.

Command: cd ..
	 scp formatted-patch.txt devyan@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu:~/Desktop

My partner also sent me his patch. I renamed it dev-formatted-patch.txt.
I checked out version 3.0 to a new branch partner.

Command: git checkout v3.0 -b partner

I then ran the command git am to apply the patch in this new branch.

Command: git am < dev-formatted-patch.txt

I then had to remake diffutils.

Commands: ./bootstrap
	  patch -p0 < ../diffutils-gets.diff
	  ./configure
	  make
	  make check

I then verified that my partner's patch worked by running the following commands.

src/diff . -
src/diff --help

Both these commands gave outputs where all backticks were replaced with apostrophes. Thus, the patch worked.

9. I then had to verify that the ChangeLog entry works by running the command
make distdir.

Command: make distdir

This created a new directory called diffutils-3.0.1-cfc7. This directory contained my partner's ChangeLog.

10. I then cd'd into ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. I ran the command gitk and received
the following error.
Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment
variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.7" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)

I resolved this issue by logging out of the seasnet server and ssh'ing' back in
with port forwarding.

Command: ssh -X rishab@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

I then moved the the ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs directory and ran the command gitk.

This opened up a gitk window on my local device.

I identified that the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25 was,
Merge branch 'master' into xwidget 2015-01-25 12:19:27
