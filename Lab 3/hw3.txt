Q1. The patch simply removes an if statement and replaces it with a single
assignment statement. The performance might improve by a very small factor
due to this.
The functionality is improved as the -a option doesn't override the -A
option any longer.

Q2. If my company adopts this patched version of Coreutils, we would have to
look out for any code that is dependant on the buggy behavior of the ls
command. If this was true it would cause issues when applied with code
that requires the -a option to override the -A option.

Q3. The /dev/null file is an empty file. Since the python file randline.py 
attempts to read from the file and display a randomly chosen line, it fails
on /dev/null. When attempting to choose a random line it throws the error:
File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))] # raises IndexError if seq is empty.
IndexError: list index out of range.

Q4. When you run randline.py with python3 instead of python you get the 
following error:
File "randline.py", line 65
except IOError as (errno, strerror):
       	          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Python3 deprecated automatic tuple unpacking, and since the errors passed
were a tuple, the syntax error was reported. Python used to iterate over
the parameters passed to the exception and thus used a tuple.
Python3 does not do that.
A fix for the issue would be to have the following statement instead:
except IOError as e:
       errno, strerror = e.args
