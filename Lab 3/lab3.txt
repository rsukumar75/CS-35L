I began the lab by logging into linux server 07.
I moved to a new directory for this assignment using the cd command.

The first thing I did was grab the Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed 
tarball using the wget command.
Command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

Next, I grabbed the compressed tarball signature using the wget command.
Command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

Next, I grabbed the gnu-keyring.gpg file using the wget command.
Command: wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

The compressed tarball file was now in my working directory.
I tried verifying its signature with the GNU keyring by running the 
shell command gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
On running this command a file trustdb.gpg was created in the following
directory: /u/cs/ugrad/rishab/.gnupg/
It is said to be a good signature from "Padraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
aka "Padraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>" aka "Padraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
I received a warning saying that this key was not certified with a trusted
signature and that there was no indication that the signature belonged to 
the owner. These messages were displayed because I hadn't used my own private
key to sign the coreutils key as trusted.

I then unzipped the compressed tarball file using the following command:
tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

I created a temporary directory called coreutils-install using the mkdir
command.
Command: mkdir coreutils-install

I then moved to the coreutils-8.29 directory using the cd command.
Command: cd coreutils-8.29

Once inside the directory I read the the INSTALL file using emacs INSTALL.

I ran ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/rishab/CS35L/assignment3/
coreutils-install

The prefix ensures that coreutils is installed in the directory of my choosing.
This configured the Makefile.

I then ran the following commands:
make
make install

This installed coreutils in the directory /u/cs/ugrad/rishab/CS35L/assignment3/
coreutils-install

I then moved to the coreutils-install/bin directory using the cd command.

I entered the ls command to see all the files within the directory.

I then ran the command ./ls -a -A and observed the issue.
The -A option is always overrided by the -a option.

I then copied the text from the patch file obtained through the assignment page.
I pasted this text into a new file called patchfile.diff within the 
coreutils-8.29 directory.

I then applied the patch from within the coreutils-8.29 directory using
the command patch -p1 < patchfile.diff
This runs the patch after stripping the text before the first slash in all the
filenames in the patch file.
Thus, a/src/ls.c becomes src/ls.c

After applying the patch I run the make command within the same directory.
This builds the fixed version.
make  all-recursive
Recursively run through all the directories within the current directory and
recompile files that have been modified by the patch.

make[2]: Leaving directory `/w/home.20/cs/ugrad/rishab/CS35L/assignment3/

No files in the po directory need to be recompiled. Thus, this step is not
necessary.

The above files were modified by the patch. Thus, they are recompiled.

No files in gnulib-tests need to be recompiled. Thus, this step is not 
necessary

make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.20/cs/ugrad/rishab/CS35L/assignment3/
coreutils-8.29'

I then cd into the src directory and run the command ./ls -a -A
It does not display hidden dot files any more.
I cd into the directory coreutils-install/bin and run the command ./ls -a -A
It still displays hidden dot files.
Thus, the patch fixes the bug.
